参考范文：
It is bad for our body to play computer games for too long.My friend Jimmy likes playing computer games and always sits in the same way without moving, so he has a headache, sore eyes and a sore back now.He can't move his neck and he doesn't have a good sleep at night, either.
I think Jimmy had better take breaks away from the computer first.Next, he should do eye exercises to relax his eyes and lie down to have a rest.Then, he might have to drink more water.Maybe he can drink hot tea with honey.Finally, if he still feels bad，he should go to a doctor.
If Jimmy has a healthy lifestyle, he will feel better soon.

Many teenagers don't do housework at home.They think there is no need for them to do housework at home.
In my opinion, it's important for teenagers to do housework at home, because it can help us learn to be independent and learn how to look after ourselves.Besides, our parents are often tired after work and they need our help.We should play a part in keeping the house clean and tidy.So I often help with chores around the house, like taking out the trash and doing the dishes after dinner.What's more, I make my bed and fold the clothes.
It's believed that the earlier we start doing chores, the better it is for our future.

Dear__sir，
I think students should take after­school classes.Here are the reasons.First, if they take after­school classes, they can learn more exam skills so that they can get into a good high school and later a good university.Second, students can take up a new hobby in after­school classes.Some students can even practice sports to improve their physical health.
I also take English and physics classes on weekends.I like the lessons because I can make more friends and improve myself as well.
All in all, it is necessary for students to take after­school classes.
Yours，
Lam

Dear__sir，
I don't think students should take after­school classes.Here are three reasons.First, students are very busy at school, so they need to relax after school.Second, parents always compare their children with others.I don't think it's fair for children.Third, too many after­school classes can cause a lot of stress for children.
I also take English and physics classes on weekends, but I don't like it because it's a waste of my time.
All in all, I think students should have enough time to relax and think for themselves.
Yours，
Lam

Yu Gong Moves a Mountain
There are many meaningful folk stories in traditional Chinese culture.I'd like to tell you a famous story called Yu Gong Moves a Mountain.
Once upon a time there was an old man named Yu Gong.There were mountains in front of his house and it took him a long time to the other side, so he led his family to try to move the mountains.Two gods were so moved that they helped him move the mountains away.From the story I learn that we'll never know what's possible unless we try to make it happen.
Traditional stories play an important role in Chinese culture.As Chinese, it's our duty to pass on our traditional culture.

The white­flag dolphins are in great danger.It's very important to protect them because they are our friends and part of our environment.
White­flag dolphins live in fresh water.They like to eat fish.They can live up to be 30 years old.However, people keep fishing and more and more water is polluted, so there are fewer and fewer white­flag dolphins in China.We must stop this.I think people should try their best to keep the water clean.And the Chinese government should make laws to stop people from fishing.
Let's play an active role in protecting white­flag dolphins!

Spring is the peak of the flu.If you have a fever, a headache or a cough, I am afraid you probably have the flu.Having the flu makes you sick, but you can do something to help yourself get better.
First, you should go to a doctor and have a good rest.Second, drinking some chicken soup will help you, too.If you don't want to have the flu easily, you should do more exercise to make yourself strong, and often wash your hands before eating.
I hope all of you can be healthy.

How to Deal with the Trouble in Our Life
Nowadays, more and more students have too much trouble and are under great stress.
It is important for us to deal with the trouble properly.For example，if you argue with your friends, what should you do? In my opinion, you should call him or her to say sorry.Second, you can also invite him or her to see a film.What's more, you could write him or her a letter and tell him or her your feelings.I think your relationship will be better.And you will feel happy again.
All in all, it's necessary to find a good way to deal with our trouble.I hope my advice will be helpful.

How to Keep Ourselves Safe
Safety is very important to everyone, and students' safety is becoming the focus to us all.
To keep ourselves safe, first, we must follow the traffic rules when we go out.Second, we should eat healthy and safe food.Before we eat, make sure the food is clean and safe enough.Besides, it's dangerous to swim alone, so don't go to the river without permission.
In a word, it's important for us all to remember these to keep us away from danger.

B．书面表达
My favorite story is The Emperor's New Clothes.It is about a king who loved beautiful clothes very much.Because he wanted to get special clothes, two men cheated him.They said they could make the most beautiful clothes in the world.But finally when the emperor put on the new clothes, he could see nothing but only his underwear.Everyone said the clothes were great except a little boy.He told the truth and said the emperor was wearing nothing.
From this story, I learn that it is very important to be honest and not to tell lies.

In__recent__years，WeChat__is__becoming__increasingly__popular. There are many reasons for WeChat to be known.To begin with, WeChat is a cheaper way of communication.Besides, WeChat has various functions(功能) and it is available everywhere at any time.
However, every coin has two sides.People may make fewer communications with others face to face by using WeChat.Moreover, it will influence our attention to work.
I think people should deal with WeChat properly.They shouldn't use it when being with their families.And they should stop using it while working.I hope WeChat can make our life much better in the future.
